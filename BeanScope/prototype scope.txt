everytime we create a bean of prototype scope, we will get a brand new object
this is used to avoid race conditions
this is used where data of the object is changed many times 
this is rarely used and be very careful with using this

if your parent class bean scope is singleton then the child class dependency which you are autowring inside the parent will automatically be singleton
if your parent is prototype only then the child can be prototype

for example:
I have a parent Vehicle --> @Autowired vehicleServices

now on my vehicleServices class, i have defined @Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)

now in my main class, when i get the vehcileServices bean directly, each time i get it from the context , i will get a different bean
but if i use the vehicle class to get the vehcileServices bean then each time i will get the same vehcileServices bean (here it is singleton due to vehicle)

refer example 16 from GIT repo of the course and not my repo
